\title{Breaking up a time stamp by different periods}
\usage{
by_time(breaks, start.on.monday = FALSE)

by_hour(x)

by_day(x)

by_week(x)

by_month(x)

by_quarter(x)

by_year(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{breaks}{One of numerous options for splitting a POSIX time object
up into bins according to the specified breaks. See
\code{\link{cut.POSIXt}} for more details.}

\item{start.on.monday}{logical. If breaks = "weeks", should the week start
on Mondays or Sundays?}

\item{x}{a POSIXct object.}
}
\value{
A factor representing the bins, as equivalent POSIX time stamps,
  for the first date in that bin according to the specified breaks.
}
\description{
Creates functions to break a time stamp into periods by the specified breaks.
Many options are created already for common periods, such as by hour, week,
month, and quarter.
}
\examples{
by_4months <- by_time("4 month")
    day_seq <- seq(as.POSIXct("2012-01-01 00:00:00 -0800"),
                   as.POSIXct("2013-01-01 00:00:00 -0800"), by = 'day')
    by_4months(day_seq)
    by_quarter(day_seq)
