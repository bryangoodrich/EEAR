\usage{
prepare(x, totalized = TRUE, meters = NULL, days = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data table}

\item{totalized}{Logical. Should kW be aggregated across meters.
(Default TRUE)}

\item{meters}{Optional. Meters to keep in data. Defaults to all in data.}

\item{days}{Optional. Days of week to include. Accepts numeric, with
"Sunday" equals to 1. Defaults to every day.}

\item{end_time}{The ending time of day to include. Default "23:45"}
}
\value{
A data table with 4 fields
  \itemize{
    \item timestamp. The 15-minute time stamp.
    \item interval. The interval time of day.
    \item weekday. The timestamp day of the week.
    \item kw. The total or mean kW across all selected meters.
  }
}
\description{
