}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing kW.}

\item{h}{A numeric value representing proportion of an hour represented.}

\item{sqft}{The square-footage of the represented structure.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed onto other functions.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing a calculated value.

\description{
This collection transforms a vector of kW into a vector normalized by
some factor, such as load factor and the max consumption, the energy
use index and the square-footage of the structure, or kWh as kW normalized
by its proportion of an hour.
