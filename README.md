Energy Efficiency Analytics using R
===================================

Overview
--------
The EEAR package provides a dplyr and ggplot2 based approach to using R for energy efficiency analytics. In our environment, analysts used the Itron client to access meter data reports and manually manipulate them in the number one office tool: Excel. As a solutions expert, I built an R package to help with that process as well as make it more informative. I then embedded an R Shiny web app to make using the package for non-coders even easier. 

This is largely a proof-of-concept prototype. I would recommend building proper dimensional modeling around your meter data, and using an out-of-the-box tool for your business intelligent dashboards, such as Tableau. Nevertheless, this package demonstrates an idea of what R can do in this space. With further backing, it can definitely be used as a bedrock for ME&V and custom visualizations that other tools cannot produce as easily.
